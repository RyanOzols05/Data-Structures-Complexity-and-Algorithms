# Sets
------
**What are Sets?**
------
* Sets are unordered collections of data containing no duplicates
* Set is the mathematical term for describing a collection of unique objects
* By following the characteristics and operations of a mathematical set, we can utilize a set in python
------
**Using Sets in Python**
------
*How to Define a Set*
```python

```
*Basic Built-in Functions w/ Sets*
```python

```
*Basic Membership Operators*
* 
```python

```
*Accessing Values in a Set*
* 
```python

```
*Adding/Removing Values*
* 
```python

```
------
**Powering Up Sets: Set Operators**
------

*Union*
* 
```python

```
*Intersection*
* 
```python

```
*Difference*
* 
```python

```
*Symmetric Difference*
* 
```python

```
*Proper Subset*
* 
```python

```
*Subset*
* 
```python

```
*Proper Superset*
* 
```python

```
*Superset*
* 
```python

```
------
**Disjoint: A Set Behaviour Property**
------

```python

```
------
**Set Operators as Methods**
------
```python

```
*Assignment Operation and Updating Methods*
* This is a way to affect an original set with another set while applying the result back to the original set
```python

```
------
**Set Comprehension**
------
* Sets also support comprehension
```python

```
------
**Final Notes**
------
* Sets aren't sliceable or indexable
* Sets cannot contain other sets
* Sets don't have an order or order of insertion, meaning they can't guarantee their values are in order
* Sets don't record a value's position
